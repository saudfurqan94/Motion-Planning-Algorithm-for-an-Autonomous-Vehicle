Implemented motion planning algorithm to generate a safe, collision-free path for the self-driving car in a simulated environment (CARLA Simulator).

Detect dynamic obstacles (such as vehicles or pedestrians) and adjust the path accordingly to ensure safety.

Optimize the car's trajectory to minimize parameters like travel time, distance, or jerk, ensuring smooth and efficient driving.

Handle lane changes and control the car's speed to obey traffic rules and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
